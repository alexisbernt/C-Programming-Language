# Programming in C

 C is a programming language where the types for variables (ex: int, float, char) are declared and function signatures are declared explicitly.

 C is a static typed langauge (where the type declarations are required at compile time).

 An array in C is a collection of variables that are stored in contiguous memory locations.
 
 First declare the data type: 
 Example with int: int myNumbers[] = {25, 50, 75, 100};

 char * = 

 char ** =
