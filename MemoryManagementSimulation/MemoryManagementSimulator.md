# Memory Management Simulation Program
### For our final OS homework, we are creating a Memory Management Simulator. 

Memory management simulator is going to mimic the behavior of memory managment techniques that are used in computer systems.
There are different memory allocation strategies:
- First-fit
- Best-fit
- Worst-fit
- Next-fit
- Paging and segmentation
This program will simulate multiple processes competing for memory space and track how processes are loaded into memory and removed
Memory gets partitioned, allocated, or fragmented.
